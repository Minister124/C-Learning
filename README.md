This Application is my first step to learning C++ Programming. It is a Simple Task Manager Console Application where users can Add, View, and Mark them as Complete and Incomplete with the proper interaction with the Application. I am still on this journey, Hope you will like the final product.

Good News, I added the Category Functionality in this application where users can select the category and add tasks related to that, also they can view their tasks according to the category.
